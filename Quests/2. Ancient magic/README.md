## _Uses_
Ancient magic are amazing spells to quickly gain magic exp with combat in large groups of enemies.
Due to there being 4 elements each with their own effects and each element having 4 variations of the spell.
These versions are Rush, Burst, Blitz & Barrage.
The 4 elements and their effects are in order:
	- Smoke : Reduces targets hit chance by 5% for 10s (air spell)
	- Shadow: Reduces targets damage dealth by 5% for 10s (earth spell)
	- Blood : Heals caster for 5% of the total damage dealth (fire spell)
	- Ice   : Roots target in place for 10s, or 2.4s in PVP (water spell)
These are the main reason one wants to unlock as with Burst & Barrage one will always cast in a 3x3 area, while Rush & Blitz do more damage to a single target.

Aside from these spells, the teleports and other spells rarely see use outside of the Crystallize & Crystal Mask spells.
Crystallize : Crystallizes a skilling plot (fishing spot, tree, hunter trap, mining rock) for an addition 25% xp for no exp.
			  You can only have 1 Crystallize active at a time and it lasts for 30s, allowing you to collect exp from it once every 10s.
			  This exp boost can further be amplified by using the Light Form curse allong with it.
Crystal Mask: Crystal Mask lowers your detection rate and increases the chance to "eat" a hit from being caught while pickpocketing, lasts 5min per cast.
