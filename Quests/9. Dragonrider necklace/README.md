## _Uses_
The dragonrider necklace is a necklace with offensive stats slightly inferior to a amulet of fury, but it has a whopping +10 prayer bonus.
It also has a passive effect when burying dragon bones and variants of that (baby, reinforced, hardened & frost dragon) give you double the exp.
Aside from this it also augments the Dragonbreath magic basic ability with :
	- 10% increased damage in the cone of effect.
	- 10% chance to inflict a bleed on the target (stacking with Combust and other bleeds)
		- The bleed hits 3 times over a 10s interval
		- It deals between 20.5% & 21% damage each hit of the bleed.
