# Combined catalyst fragment
## _Sliske's Endgame_
To unlock the catalyst fragments, ring of whispers & necklace of shadows one must first complete the quest Sliske's Endgame.


## _Uses_
The ring of whispers gives a invisible boost of +3 to all gathering skills when worn. (Woodcutting, Divination, Fishing, Hunter, Farming & Mining [kind of])
The necklace of shadows remove the passive drain of summoning points on familiars when worn.
The catalyst fragments come in 3 forms and can be fused together to conserve bank space.
	- Hunter fragment : automatically resets traps on failure to catch prey.
	- Farmer fragment : on clearing a dead herb patch you gain shadow herbs which give Herblore exp, but destroy on cleaning.
	- Runecrafter fragment : reduces the drain rate on rune pouches (for essence) by 50% on filling, this stacks with Ethereal robes to go all the way to 100% reduction.
When wearing all 3 together you gain a passive effect to sometimes spawn Manifest shadows, which award you with a bit of exp when claimed.
This effect works simular to the Seren spirits with a Grace of the Elves, or the Fire spirits while adding logs to a bonfire.
