# Sunspear, the 2handed tri-brid weapon
## _River of Blood_
To unlock the 2handed Sunspear one must first complete the quest River of Blood.
If you plan on using it at vyrewatches, it is recommended to MANUALLY burn 500 vyre corpses in the catacombs on the Paterdomus.

## _Uses_
The sunspear is a level78 weapon that can be swapped between a melee spear, ranged javelin (self-returning) & magic staff at will.
This weapon is affective against vyrewatch and variants of them, it also automatically burns the corpses for you (not counting for the 500 total).
This gives you Firemaking & Prayer exp on each kill along with the drops you would have gotten out of a Columbarium key.
If lost (or used for Invention training, dissassembly) it can be reclaimed in the Paterdomus for 600k coins.
