Currently a WIP
You might be wondering, why should I ever do minigames in Runescape?

## _Bonus Experience_

Some of the minigames give you more bonus experience/h.
This means 1 hour in the minigame will save you more than 1 hour of skilling at max efficiency.
Heist : Hunter & Thieving bonus exp, very afk and very high.
Barbarian Assault : Firemaking, Mining & Agility, extremely high in a coordinated team. (upwards of 2m bxp/h)
Stealing Creaion : Crafting, Construction, Fishing, Woodcutting, Fletching, Mining, Smithing & Hunter
Flash Powder Factory : Thieving & Agility, can get up to 1m thieving/h or 500k agility/h among other things (not bonus exp)
Guthixian caches : amazing divination exp/h at lower lvls (almost mandatory to train fast)
